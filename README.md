# Retina Icon for Caffeine.app
### Also works with Dark/Night Mode in macOS

Tired of the pixelated icon of Caffeine for macOS?

Change it out with these icon assets for a refreshed look.<sup>1</sup>

### Install:

1) Download the [icon assets](https://github.com/natepnewton/caffeine-retina-dark-mode/blob/master/caffeine-retina-assets.zip).
2) Quit `Caffeine.app`.
3) Unzip the assets folder.
4) Open your `Applications` folder and find `Caffeine.app`.
5) Right-click `Caffeine.app` and select `Show Package Contents`.
6) Open `Contents > Resources`
7) Copy the original images to a backup location of your choosing.
> Original Icon Titles
> * active.png
> * inactive.png
> * highlighted.png
> * highlightactive.png
8) Replace the images in `Contents > Resources` with the new Retina assets.
> *Authenicate with your Admin account if necessary*
9) Open `Caffeine.app`.
10) Enjoy!

### Minor Bug:

* Right clicking on Caffeine in the menubar - and then clicking away - leaves the menubar icon continually highlighted. This seems to be a bug within the app itself. Simply relaunching Caffeine rids this.
